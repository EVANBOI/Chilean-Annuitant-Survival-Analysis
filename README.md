# Survival Analysis of Chilean Annuitants

## Project Overview
This project analyses the mortality of Chilean Annuitants from 2014 to 2018 with the aim to identify whether the current assumptions used to price annuities are valid. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, survival analysis, life table graduation, and an ethical evaluation of gender-based pricing.

## Data Analysis Stages 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
**Objective:** 
- Within the dataset, several annuitants ages reached up to roughly 130 years old. This unrealistic/bad data has to be cleaned as the oldest person recorded Jeanne Calment was aged 122. Due to the scractiy of data and the absence of verification for these supercenternarions.
- Generate visualisations and summary statistics to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.

**Key Findings** 
- Potential predictors for future analysis include:
  - Age of the annuitant
  - Gender of the annuitant
